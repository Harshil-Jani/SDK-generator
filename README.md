# Quick Prototyping of SDK Generator

- [ ] Using the swagger-codegen try to analyse the following :
    - What is generated ?
    - What is supposed to be written still by us after generation ?
    - What lags in Swagger CodeGen ?
- [ ] Describe use case of our SDK prototyping 
    - As `affinidi` stands for VC's and DID's what is our motive to achieve with the SDK ?
    - What we can take from affinidi and swagger gen ?
    - List things which don't exist among those two and we want them. 
- [ ] An Attempt for PoC of the generator itself
